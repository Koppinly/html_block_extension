# html_block_extension
Written as a solution for ASU. This was designed to address an issue where the Optimizely Visual Editor was not allowing a button to be clicked as the editor was wrapping the button in a single <opty-data> change. In the interest of reusing the HTML block in various experiment's, I've created an Optimizely Extension that allows you to insert it as needed.
