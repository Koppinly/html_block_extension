# html_block_extension
Written as a solution for ASU. This was designed to address an issue where the Optimizely Visual Editor was not allowing a button to be clicked as the editor was wrapping the button in a single <opty-data> change. In the interest of reusing the HTML block in various experiment's, I've created an Optimizely Extension that allows you to insert it as needed. 


**Steps to Implement**

1. Locate the **asu_mock_up_extension.json** file provided in this repo.
2. Copy the JSON file.
3. Visit Implementation -> Extensions (Tab) --> Create New Extension --> Using JSON
4. Paste the JSON in the field and save
5. In the Extensions menu, click the Three Dots associated with ASU Mock Up, and click Enable.

The Extension is now available in the Visual Editor panel for each experiment. 


**To Apply to An Experiment**
